I am a MRI researcher at the Cuban Centre for Neuroscience. I have contributed to several [research projects](/research/) :file_folder: involving neurodegenerative diseases, brain imaging biomarkers, artificial intelligence methods and MRI research. 

I am enrolled in a Masters' degree :notebook: in Neuroscience from CNEURO, focusing on MRI relaxometry and contrast agent characterization. My [research interests](/research/) :bookmark: include: quantitative MRI techniques, brain imaging biomarkers, neuroimaging analysis and MRI quality control and pulse sequences.

I'm passionate about using machine learning and data analysis techniques :bar_chart: to extract meaningful insights from data.

Parallel to my research, I [teach](/teaching/) :book: Python programming and MRI physics at CNEURO.

In my free time, I'm an avid coder :computer: (check out my [portfolio](/portfolio/)). I also love staying active through biking :bicyclist: and working out :muscle:. When relaxing, I enjoy listening to jazz :saxophone: and classical music :violin: . I'm also passionate about reading books :books: on math, physics, engineering, and psychology, and I have a deep appreciation for nature :evergreen_tree: and animals :smiley_cat:.

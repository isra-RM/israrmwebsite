I'm a nuclear physicist with a Master's degree in Neuroscience, currently working at [CNEURO](https://cneuro.cu/).
I apply quantitative MRI techniques and neuroimaging analysis to extract potential brain imaging biomarkers of neurodegeneration. My analytical toolkit includes proficiency in Python, R, and MATLAB. I am also passionate about data science and machine learning .
